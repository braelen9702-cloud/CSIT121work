                 Hello, my name is Braelen Cypress.
                I am 22 years old and my birthday is September 7th.
                This is my very first time in college, and I hope for it to be a good one.
                I am attending community college to earn an associate's degree in IT, which will serve as a foundation for pursuing my career in cybersecurity.

                I have the ability to multitask in desperate situations, I sometimes become hyperfocused,
                and I love creativity.
